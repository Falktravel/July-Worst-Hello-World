# July-Worst-Hello-World
The goal is to write, in the programming language of your choice, the WORST version of a working program displaying "Hello World". 
By worst version, we mean the least elegant, the least useful, in short the hardest way you can. 
Slow does not mean worst, so no tricks there!
