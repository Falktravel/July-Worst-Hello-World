//needed to have some code under int main void.  Not sure what brackets would do in this slashed up area. 
//Why do 2 // allow for a sentence which is out of the code realm?
//Seems that without the // anything written appears as code. int main(void)

	//proper input the function doesn't run.  Haha i nearly missed my forward slashes before proof reading
